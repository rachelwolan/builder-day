## Core Dimensions for Product Organizations

The AI Product Org Maturity Model assesses five key dimensions that determine an organization's ability to build AI-native products:

1. **Prototyping & Design Velocity** - How quickly Product and Design teams can go from idea to interactive prototype
2. **Data & Insights Automation** - How effectively Data Science and Research teams use AI to accelerate analysis and discovery
3. **Tool Fluency & Infrastructure** - The depth and breadth of AI tool adoption across all product teams
4. **Cross-Functional Builder Culture** - How well PM, Design, Data, and Research collaborate using AI tools
5. **Learning & Experimentation** - The organization's ability to learn from experiments and continuously improve

Each dimension is assessed across five maturity levels, with specific indicators for Product Management, Product Design, Data Science, and User Research roles.

## Format Presentation Ideas

### Visual Format Options

1. **Matrix View** (Most Common)
   - Rows: Dimensions
   - Columns: Maturity Levels
   - Cells: Descriptions, indicators, or scores
   - Color gradient from low (red/orange) to high (green/blue)

2. **Spider/Radar Chart**
   - Each dimension as a spoke
   - Current state plotted as a shape
   - Target state as outer ring
   - Shows gaps visually

3. **Journey Map Format**
   - Horizontal progression through levels
   - Each level shows "what it looks like"
   - Clear "next steps" to advance

4. **Card-Based Assessment**
   - Each dimension as a card
   - Self-assessment checklist
   - Visual progress indicators
   - Action items per level

### Document Structure

1. **Cover/Introduction**
   - Model name and purpose
   - Who it's for
   - How to use it

2. **Overview Section**
   - What is AI-native maturity?
   - Why it matters
   - Model structure explanation

3. **Dimension Deep Dives**
   - Each dimension gets 2-3 pages
   - Level descriptions
   - Assessment questions
   - Examples and case studies

4. **Assessment Tool**
   - Self-assessment questionnaire
   - Scoring methodology
   - Results interpretation

5. **Roadmap/Next Steps**
   - How to advance from current level
   - Recommended initiatives per level
   - Resources and support

6. **Appendices**
   - Glossary
   - Tool recommendations
   - Training resources
   - Case studies

---

## Key Differentiators for AI Native Focus

Unlike generic AI maturity models, emphasize:

1. **Product Development Speed** - How quickly can you go from idea to prototype?
2. **Builder Culture** - Is experimentation celebrated and safe?
3. **Cross-Functional AI Use** - PM, Design, Data all using AI tools
4. **Prototype-to-Value** - Not just AI adoption, but impact on product outcomes
5. **Tool Fluency** - Not just having tools, but using them effectively
6. **Learning Velocity** - How fast does the org learn and adapt?

---

## Assessment Approach

### Self-Assessment Questions (Example Format)

For each dimension, provide 3-5 questions per level:

**Tool Adoption - Level 3 Example:**
- [ ] Do you have a standardized set of AI tools approved for product teams?
- [ ] Are AI tools integrated into your standard project kickoff templates?
- [ ] Do you offer quarterly training on AI tools?
- [ ] Is tool usage tracked and measured across teams?
- [ ] Can new team members easily access and learn approved tools?

**Scoring:**
- 0-2 Yes = Level 1
- 3-4 Yes = Level 2
- 5+ Yes = Level 3 (move to Level 4 questions)

---

## Next Steps for Development

1. **Review AEOMM PDF** - Extract exact format elements you want to preserve
2. **Define Dimensions** - Finalize the 5-7 key dimensions
3. **Write Level Descriptions** - Create detailed descriptions for each dimension × level
4. **Create Assessment Tool** - Build the self-assessment questionnaire
5. **Design Visual Format** - Choose matrix, radar, or journey map style
6. **Add Examples** - Include real-world examples and case studies
7. **Test with Internal Team** - Validate the model with your own org first

---

## Questions to Consider

1. **Audience:** Is this for internal use, external sharing, or both?
2. **Depth:** How detailed should each level description be?
3. **Visual Style:** Should it match your Builder Day brand/aesthetic?
4. **Interactivity:** Will this be a static PDF or interactive tool?
5. **Updates:** How often will you refresh the model as AI evolves?

---

## Inspiration from Builder Day Context

Your Builder Day framework already includes:
- **Tracks** (Prototyping, Insights)
- **Categories** (Learning, Interaction Design, Workflow, Data, Creative)
- **Success Metrics** (Participation, Completion, Tool Adoption, Confidence)

Consider aligning maturity model dimensions with these existing frameworks for consistency.
